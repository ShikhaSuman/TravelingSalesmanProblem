Various Python implementations of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem. These were done for my Design and Analysis of Algorithms class to explore how different problem solving techniques can affect execution times. The methods used are:
	1. A brute force method
	2. A greedy method (Nearest Neighbor algorithm)
	3. A probabilistic method (2-opt algorithm)
